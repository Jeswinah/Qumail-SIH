# 🚀 QuMail Vercel Deployment - Fixed Version

## ✅ Fixed Deployment Issues

The previous deployment failure was due to React 19 compatibility issues with testing libraries. This has been resolved by:

1. **Removed Testing Dependencies** - Cleaned package.json for production
2. **Added .npmrc** - Ensures legacy peer deps are used
3. **Updated vercel.json** - Proper configuration for Vercel deployment
4. **Simplified Build Process** - Focus on production build only

## 📦 Current Configuration

### package.json (Cleaned)

- ✅ React 19.1.1 (latest)
- ✅ Vite 7.1.2 (latest)
- ✅ No conflicting test dependencies
- ✅ All QuMail dependencies compatible

### .npmrc

```
legacy-peer-deps=true
fund=false
audit=false
```

### vercel.json

```json

  "functions": {
    "api/km/[...path].js": { "maxDuration": 10 },
